# Galactic-Outflow-Models

The scripts shown here were used in my research to model galactic outflows. In particular, modelling the shocks produced by these supersonic outflows is critical to understanding the rate at which gas and other material is ejected from the galaxy. This in turn has a direct effect on the star formation rate of the given galaxy.

Two posters showcasing this work were presented at the 230th and 231st American Astronomical Society meetings.
